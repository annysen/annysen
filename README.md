# 👋 Hi there! I'm Anny Sen  

**A Web Developer turned System Engineering Enthusiast**

---

I began my journey in tech as a **Frontend Developer**, crafting responsive UIs using **React**, **JavaScript**, and design tools like **Figma**. Over time, my curiosity pulled me deeper into the world of backend systems, infrastructure, and cloud technologies.

Currently, I'm working as a **Junior System Engineer** at **Global Brand Pvt Ltd.**, where I provide hands-on support for **Dell PowerEdge Servers** and **Enterprise Storage Systems**. I'm actively exploring **cloud infrastructure**, **OpenStack**, and **Linux system administration**.

> I'm passionate about bridging the gap between development and infrastructure — from web to cloud. Let's build something awesome together! ☁️💻🚀
